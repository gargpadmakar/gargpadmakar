## üöÄ About Me

üë®‚Äçüíª**Padmakar Garg | Mobile App Developer**

Hello! I‚Äôm Padmakar Garg, a passionate and dedicated mobile app developer with a strong focus on Android app development. Since starting my journey in Android development in 2020, I have honed my skills and embraced best practices in mobile app development to deliver high-quality solutions for my clients.

I firmly believe that great mobile applications are the result of a combination of patience, understanding, continuous research, and effective problem-solving. My approach to app development involves paying careful attention to every detail, ensuring that the final product not only meets but exceeds client expectations.

As an experienced Android developer, I am proficient in developing both native Android applications using **Kotlin** and **Java**. I have a solid understanding of key Android frameworks, including **Android Studio**, **Firebase**, **Firebase Cloud Messaging**, and **Google Play Services**. Additionally, I am skilled in working with various Android libraries such as **Retrofit**, **Glide**, **Picasso**, and many more to enhance app performance and functionality.

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of what I can bring to the table:

- **Native Android Development**: Expertise in developing fully functional and interactive Android apps using **Kotlin** and **Java**.
- **Firebase Integration**: Experience in integrating **Firebase** for real-time databases, **Firebase Cloud Messaging** for push notifications, and other Firebase services.
- **App UI/UX Design**: Skilled in creating intuitive, user-friendly designs, ensuring seamless navigation and a visually appealing interface.
- **API Integration**: Proficient in connecting Android apps to external APIs, allowing data exchange with cloud services and third-party systems.
- **Background Services**: Expertise in implementing background services and notifications to ensure smooth operation of apps even when they are not in the foreground.
- **Advanced UI Components**: Knowledge of using advanced UI components like **RecyclerView**, **GridView**, **ProgressBar**, **ListView**, and **Custom Dialogs** to improve app functionality and user experience.
- **Problem-Solving & Optimization**: I focus on solving complex problems and optimizing app performance to ensure smooth and efficient functioning.

I am continuously learning new technologies and improving my skill set to stay ahead in the fast-evolving world of mobile app development. If you're looking for someone who is dedicated to delivering high-quality, reliable, and scalable Android applications, I‚Äôd be more than happy to assist you in your next project, whether it‚Äôs from scratch or helping you optimize and improve your current application.
üíª I specialize in **Kotlin**, **Java**, **Android Development**, and have a keen interest in **Cyber Security**.  
üõ°Ô∏è I developed **AppProtectGuard**, a security library designed for Android applications that helps detect various types of vulnerabilities and unauthorized modifications. It can detect rooted devices, emulators, active debuggers, VPN usage, proxy settings, and more, ensuring that your app runs in a secure environment and provides protection against tampering.  
‚ù§Ô∏è I'm a proud **open-source contributor**, and I love collaborating with like-minded developers to bring exciting projects to life.  
ü§ù Let's build something amazing together! Feel free to reach out if you're working on an open-source project and need a helping hand.
